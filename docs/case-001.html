    <h2>Event overview</h2>
    <p>
      On 11 January 2026, video footage circulated on social media platforms
      showing an incident reported to have taken place in Iran. The videos were
      widely shared and subsequently referenced by multiple independent accounts
      and media-related profiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to restrictions on independent reporting and limited access for
      international observers, open-source material such as publicly shared
      videos plays an important role in documenting events. This page does not
      claim to establish legal responsibility or definitive conclusions but
      serves as a structured reference point for the available material.
